# Withdrawal workflows

Withdrawals move money from platform balances to external bank accounts or wallets.

## Checklist before releasing funds
- Confirm the account passed **KYC/KYB** and banking details are verified.
- Make sure there is no ongoing dispute or chargeback.
- Check the available balance after fees.

## <a id="withdrawal-limits"></a>Withdrawal limits
- Daily default limit: **$25,000** per merchant.
- Rolling 30-day limit scales with risk score.
- Administrators can create overrides from **Risk → Limits**.

## <a id="compliance-review"></a>Compliance review
If the risk engine flags a payout:
1. The status changes to **Under review**.
2. Compliance receives a task with submitted documents.
3. Merchants are notified and can upload additional evidence.
4. Analysts approve or reject the payout.

## <a id="failed-payouts"></a>Handling failed payouts
- Inspect the failure code in **Logs → Payout history**.
- For code `BANK01` ask the merchant to validate beneficiary details.
- For `AML02` request updated KYC documents and resubmit.
- Once corrected, reschedule the payout; the system will log the retry.

### Automation
Enable **Auto-resubmit** for low-risk failures so payouts queue automatically after correction.
