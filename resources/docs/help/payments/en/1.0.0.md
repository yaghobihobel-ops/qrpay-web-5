# Payments operations

Payments help you collect funds from customers across channels.

## Getting ready
- Activate at least one payment gateway in **Settings → Payment Providers**.
- Configure settlement accounts under **Finance → Settlement Rules**.
- Share the team playbook so support knows how to assist customers.

## <a id="create-payment-link"></a>Create a payment link
1. Go to **Payments → Payment links**.
2. Choose the settlement wallet and currency.
3. Define the amount or keep it open for customer input.
4. Enable optional features (invoice upload, due date, reminders).
5. Copy the secure link and share it with your customer.

**Tip:** Use UTM parameters to track marketing attribution.

## <a id="settlement-window"></a>Settlement window
- Domestic card settlements: **T+1** business day.
- International cards: **T+3** business days.
- Mobile wallets: settle instantly but reconciliation runs hourly.

You can override settlement destination by creating routing rules per country.

## <a id="retry-policies"></a>Retrying failed payments
- Customers can retry a failed card payment up to **three** times in 24 hours.
- Webhooks fire `payment.failed` and include a `retry_token`.
- Use the retry token to re-open the hosted checkout with saved customer data.

### Monitoring
Create an alert when failure rate exceeds **5%** within a rolling 30 minute window. Use the **Analytics → Alerting** module.
