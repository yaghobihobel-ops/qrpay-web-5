# Virtual cards

Virtual cards let customers spend online with controlled limits.

## Issuance flow
1. Ensure the account is KYC approved and has available balance.
2. Select **Cards → Issue card** and pick the network (Visa/Mastercard).
3. Configure spending limit, validity period, and allowed merchant categories.
4. Confirm issuance; the system returns PAN, CVV, and expiry via secure vault.
