# Virtual cards

Virtual cards let customers spend online with controlled limits.

## Issuance flow
1. Ensure the account is KYC approved and has available balance.
2. Select **Cards → Issue card** and pick the network (Visa/Mastercard).
3. Configure spending limit, validity period, and allowed merchant categories.
4. Confirm issuance; the system returns PAN, CVV, and expiry via secure vault.

## <a id="funding-options"></a>Funding options
- Direct wallet transfer.
- Auto top-up when balance drops below threshold.
- Scheduled funding aligned with payroll cycles.

## <a id="card-security"></a>Security actions
- Freeze, unfreeze, or terminate a card instantly from **Cards → Manage**.
- Rotate CVV for high-risk merchants.
- Subscribe to real-time spend alerts through webhooks.

## <a id="issue-card"></a>Issuance SLA
Cards are normally provisioned within **30 seconds**. If provisioning exceeds 2 minutes the job is retried automatically.

### Reporting
Use the card ledger export to reconcile funding versus spend by department.
